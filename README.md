# simanneal
A quick implementation of [simulated annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) for the purposes of testing it out.

## Usage
### Prerequisites
First you're going to need any version of [dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download). This was built and tested with dotnet 8, but I don't think anything in here is pushing the boundaries of new featues here, so it may work in all versions (but this is an untested claim).

### Installation
This is so lightweight that there is no option to install but through source. Simply install the source code and run `dotnet build` in its root directory. You should have a build in the created bin folder now.
